version 0.94
    - fixed execute sql statement [execute] [clear] javascript error -ai
    - added javascript so login window reloads itself into _top -ai
    - added check for Apache request object in handler. if found,
      check content type of request so images are displayed properly
      even if mysqltool is defined as the handler under a <Location /> tag. -ai
    - added cookie test. if cookies are disabled in user's browser,
      mysqltool will now complain loudly (only in MULTI USER mode). -ai
    - added configurable document type charset variable -ji
    - changed cookie generation so a path is not explicitly defined -ai
    - fixed 'dbh destroyed without explicit disconnect' problem -ai

version 0.93
    - fixed bug that was causing newly created tables to be put in the
      wrong database -ji
    - added an exception check after loading DBI or Apache::DBI in 
      mysqltool.conf [thanks Gerrit] -ji

version 0.92
    - changed form method to POST on the login screen [thanks Konrad Bernlöhr] -ji

version 0.91
    - added support for limiting connections to a pre-defined list of servers
      [thanks Eric] -ji
    - reverted to old syntax for loading DBI or Apache::DBI...the change in .90
      has been causing problems with mod_perl -ji
    - the remote ip is now being captured from the %ENV variable rather than the
      connection object -ji

version 0.90
    - created (more, modified) mutli user mode to allow independent database user ids
      and passwords across many different sessions to the same mysqltool
      installation. One nice side effect is that $MysqlTool::Servers no longer
      has to be explicitly defined, amoung other features. DB connection
      info is stored in a Blowfish-encrypted cookie. -ji [thanks Eric Smith]
    - fixed bug causing warning in error log 'Database handle destroyed
      without explicit disconnect' -ji
    - completely rewrote and reorganized MysqlTool.pm's POD. -ai
    - fixed 'order by' bug caused by improper SQL statement parsing. related
      bugs were found and also fixed, although the regex's still need 
      work, or we need a real mysql statement parser. -ai [thanks Bill Gerrard]
    - when viewing query record sets, 'New Record' link will now
      only be shown for queries involving one table. -ai
    - changed links & email address in code/docs to point to dajoba.com
      rather than the mysqltool.com placeholder. -ai
    - minor touchup to query output. Every 20th row, a label/heading table
      was displayed, even at the bottom of the page before the last record. 
      Also made the number of rows between labels configurable via
      $MysqlTool::row_header_frequency. -ai
    - added checks to set default values in critical $MysqlTool:: variables
      if the variable wasn't properly defined in mysqltool.conf. -ai

version 0.85
    - added function compare_version for checking mysql version for 
      support for certain features. -ji
    - removed dependancy for SQL::Statement. This fixed the problem
      where some SQL statements weren't being allowed to execute. -ji
    - In the query frame text was added next to the "limit" text boxes
      to show that they should be used instead of a limit clause. -ji
    - added variable $MysqlTool::query_frame_height to make it easier 
      for users to change the query frame height if it doesn't fit 
      in their browser. -ji
    - added check to see if the number of primary key columns equals 
      the total number of columns and if so don't show edit link. -ji
    - mysqltool now handles blank root username and password in the
      %MysqlTool::servers variable -ji [thanks João Pedro Gonçalves]
